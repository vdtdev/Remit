=====
---
A simple timer that can be started and stopped. Intended for keeping track of how much time passes whilst
engaged in an acitivity.

-

##Code##
Remit is written in C#.
###Language###
Remit was built targeting .NET v4.0 Client Profile.
The release build targets use the C# 3.0 standard.

###Notes###
Though a 64-bit build target is included, there is really no advantage to using it.



##TODO:##
* Implement 'micro' mode, which reduces the size of Remit to be less visually obtrusive
	+	'Micro' mode UI created
	+	Enhanced constructor added to Micro mode form and normal form
* Optimize to use less memory while running
